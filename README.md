## Modules:

With Daowabunga we encourage developers to integrate as few or as many modules as your heart desires. We're building each core module as an easily extendable piece of your DAOs larger pie. We strongly encourage the community to build modules of their own through our plugin economy (which we're calling **toppings**). Many more toppings will be added in the future, including messenger services (like [Terabethia](https://terabethia.ooo) for cross-chain orchestration.

**Charging Station:** Ensures target canistersâ€™ cycles balance never falls below a certain threshold 

**Governance:** Manages proposals, votes, and executes commands based on the final decision that is reached between the members of the governance committee

**DIP20 Token Standard:** A blueprint token canister that follows the DIP20 token standard.

**Upgrade Gateway:** acts as an intermediary/proxy between admins and Internet Computer's management canister. Allows for transparent and secure code upgrades

**Multi-Sig:** acts as an intermidiary between multiple identities (signers) and outside parties.
