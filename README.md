## Modules:

With Daowabunga we encourage you to integrate as few or as many modules (called **toppings**) as your heart desires. We're building each topping as an easily extendable. Many more toppings will be added in the future, and the community is encouraged to integrate their own to make for a real plug-in economy.

**Charging Station:** Ensures target canistersâ€™ cycles balance never falls below a certain threshold 

**Governance:** Manages proposals, votes, and executes commands based on the final decision that is reached between the members of the governance committee

**DIP20 Token Standard:** A blueprint token canister that follows the DIP20 token standard.

**Upgrade Gateway:** acts as an intermediary/proxy between admins and Internet Computer's management canister. Allows for transparent and secure code upgrades

**Multi-Sig:** acts as an intermidiary between multiple identities (signers) and outside parties.
